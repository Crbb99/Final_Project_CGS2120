        "Functions are essential for efficiently organizing and simplifying code. They encourage modularity and lessen repetition by encapsulating particular operations into reusable blocks. For instance, the program is more structured and debug-friendly because the arithmetic functions each handle a single operation. Any logic that has to be adjusted can be done so in one place without impacting the program as a whole. By using meaningful names and docstrings to explicitly clarify each function's purpose, this method also improves readability. The use of a centralized calculator() function for user interaction helps to streamline the process by delegating operations to the appropriate arithmetic functions. This separation of responsibilities increases maintainability because changes to the user interface logic do not affect the computing logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there are some areas in which the program could be improved. Adding sophisticated mathematical functions, such as logarithmic computations (e.g., natural log, log base 10), trigonometric functions (e.g., sine, cosine, tangent), or factorials, would make it more useful. Error handling might also be improved to handle invalid numerical inputs more graciously, resulting in a better user experience. Furthermore, implementing a history function that displays previous calculations would be beneficial for those executing several operations. Another potential improvement is to include a graphical user interface (GUI), which would make the application more user-friendly, particularly for non-technical users. Finally, adding scientific constants such as π and e, as well as customizable precision settings, might help it stand out as a powerful calculator."
